/*
  Write code that generates random addresses
  Each time you load or reload the page in a browser, your program should log
  a new randomly-generated address to the console.

  Step 1:
    Create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following:
    street number, street name, city name, state name, and zip code

  Step 2:
    Write code that randomly selects one item from each of these arrays, uses
    the selected values to construct a string containing a random address, and
    then logs the result to the console.

  Step 3:
    Save your work, load your app in the browser, open the console, and verify
    that a random address is logged.

  Step 4:
    Reload the page and verify that a different random address is logged.

  Example output:
    34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506
